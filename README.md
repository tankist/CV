Starting from 2011 we are developing single product-comparison service for our Germany-based customer. Complex backend gives our customer ability to create different price comparison portals with different designs and structure. More then 200 different parameters could be tuned. Existing functionality could be slightly improved using plugins engine. Started from team of 2 PHP devs we created first prototype in early 2012 and released at fall 2012. In 2013 team was about 5 devs, in 2014 - 7 devs. First version was created with ZF1, but in 2014 it was refactored with Phalcon. During that years I have introduced Scrum techniques in the team, customer needs focused development. Currently our project is a high load service with ~1 mln visits per day. Also I was responsible for AWS deployments. We have successfully implemented AWS auto-scaling and continuous deployment. Source code was covered by unit tests with approx. coverage ~70%.

For the last 6 month we started to move critical parts of the system (API proxyfication and aggregation) to the NodeJS engine to provide highest throughput and availability.

### Web-developer, Team-lead for Skaya, Nikolaev

_January 2007 – May 2011_

I started to work at Skaya in late 2006 as a junior developer. Worked with PHP and Javascript. In 2008 I become a Senior developer and Team Leader.

In 2008 I had introduced Zend Framework as a local company standard and all projects from this time was developed using Zend Framework.

In 2008 I have worked on Siftia.com project. This is meta-search engine created to help users review and filter classifieds from famous sites like Craigslist and Ebay. During Siftia work I have introduced full client-side driven filtering of the search results. This approach made searching and filtering very fast.

In 2010 I have introduced DDD as main approach in business logic development. This made us able to create projects much faster than it was before

In 2011 I have developed a set of Zend_Tool providers to generate DDD models for different purposes. These tools could generate models, mappers and services which makes business logic development much faster. Also I have developed Zend Constructor tool to generate Zend_Form subclasses in a simple way. All these tools have helped us to develop much faster and in a common way.
