### Web-developer, Team-lead for Skaya, Nikolaev

_January 2007 – May 2011_

I started to work at Skaya in late 2006 as a junior developer. Worked with PHP and Javascript. In 2008 I become a Senior developer and Team Leader.

In 2008 I had introduced Zend Framework as a local company standard and all projects from this time was developed using Zend Framework.

In 2008 I have worked on Siftia.com project. This is meta-search engine created to help users review and filter classifieds from famous sites like Craigslist and Ebay. During Siftia work I have introduced full client-side driven filtering of the search results. This approach made searching and filtering very fast.

In 2010 I have introduced DDD as main approach in business logic development. This made us able to create projects much faster than it was before

In 2011 I have developed a set of Zend_Tool providers to generate DDD models for different purposes. These tools could generate models, mappers and services which makes business logic development much faster. Also I have developed Zend Constructor tool to generate Zend_Form subclasses in a simple way. All these tools have helped us to develop much faster and in a common way.
